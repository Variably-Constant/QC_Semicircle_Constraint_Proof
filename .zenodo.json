  "title": "The Semicircle Constraint: A Fundamental Geometric Principle in Quantum Mechanics",
  "description": "We establish a fundamental geometric constraint governing the relationship between quantum measurement probability and quantum-classical correlation. For any normalized quantum state, the measurement probability q and quantum-classical correlation C_qc = sqrt(q(1-q)) satisfy the semicircle constraint: (q - 1/2)^2 + C_qc^2 = 1/4. This constraint emerges rigorously from the Born rule and quantum state normalization, describing a semicircle of radius 1/2 centered at (1/2, 0) in the (q, C_qc) plane. The constraint provides a geometric interpretation of the quantum-classical boundary: classical states (q -> 0 or q -> 1) lie at the endpoints with C_qc -> 0, while maximum quantum coherence (C_qc = 1/2) occurs uniquely at q = 1/2. We prove the Fisher information is constant along the semicircle trajectory, and demonstrate applications to variational quantum algorithms where the constraint explains the geometric origin of barren plateaus. Partial experimental validation on IonQ Forte-1 trapped-ion hardware (15 test points, 52 shots each, r = 0.943 correlation) confirms consistency with theoretical predictions.",
