  "title": "The Semicircle Constraint: A Geometric Framework for Quantum-Classical Correlation",
  "description": "For any normalized qubit state, the measurement probability q and quantum-classical correlation C_qc = sqrt(q(1-q)) satisfy the constraint (q - 1/2)^2 + C_qc^2 = 1/4. This is a semicircle of radius 1/2 centered at (1/2, 0) in the (q, C_qc) plane, and it follows from the Born rule and normalization alone. Classical states (q -> 0 or 1) sit at the endpoints where C_qc vanishes, while maximum coherence C_qc = 1/2 is achieved uniquely at q = 1/2. The Fisher information metric along this curve is constant, giving a total arc length of pi. We show that the constraint explains the geometric origin of barren plateaus in variational quantum algorithms: gradient variance scales as q(1-q) = C_qc^2 and vanishes at the classical endpoints. Hardware validation on IonQ Forte-1 (15 test points, 52 shots each) yields a theory-measurement correlation of r = 0.943.",

The constraint emerges from the Born rule and provides a geometric interpretation of the quantum-classical boundary. Shows q = 0.5 is the unique point of maximum coherence. Demonstrates applications to variational quantum algorithms including geometric perspective on barren plateaus.
